# next_meeting

This is a project powered by [Nylas](https://www.nylas.com/), [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) and [NiceGUI](https://nicegui.io/).

## **You can try it out [here](https://next-meeting.onrender.com/)**

In this project, we use hosted authentication to generate a grant for the user logging in. This grant will be valid until the user logs off or after a 5 days has passed. No information from the user gets stored more that the email and the grant. The only access requested and used is the calendar's events. 

3 views are provided by default, with the option of creating new views.

def custom_view(hours, minutes, title) -> None:

```
import views.custom
```

On **event_display** add the following:

```
match option_info['option']:
    case 'custom':
        views.custom.custom_view(time_tuple[0], time_tuple[1], event[0].title)
```

On **def nextmeeting(request: Request):** add the following:

```
ui.radio(["classic", "led", "word_clock", "custom"], value="classic", on_change = lambda e: choose_option(e.value))
```
